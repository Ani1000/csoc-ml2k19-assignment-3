    "So far we've learnt the most basic but crucial algorithms a data scientist and a machine learning engineer must know. We've learnt the techniques for classification and regression, and we've done some very rudementary data exploration. Hopefully, you've also done the assignments and the mini projects in the courses we recommended you to do. In this assignment, we give you a very easy dataset on which you can perform both classification and regression tasks. The purpose of this assignment is for you to try your hand out at all the techniques you've learnt so far and work on a real dataset to figure out whether what you learnt up until now works."
